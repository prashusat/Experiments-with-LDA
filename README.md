<b>Overview:</b> 
<b>Experiments with LDA</b>
In this programming project we implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and inspect its
performance both in an unsupervised manner and when used as a preprocessing step for supervised
learning. Your goals in this assignment are to (i) implement the collapsed Gibbs sampler for LDA
inference, and (ii) compare the LDA topic representation to a \bag-of-words" representation with
respect to how well they support document classication.
